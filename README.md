# Todo App

## Project Description
This is a simple Todo application built with React. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, updating, deleting, and filtering todos. The app supports multiple actions, such as marking tasks as completed, clearing completed tasks, and toggling the status of all tasks. It uses an API to persist data and provides a responsive UI with a modern design.

## Features
- **Add, Remove, and Update Todos**: You can easily manage your tasks.
- **Filter Todos**: Filter tasks based on their status (All, Active, Completed).
- **Toggle All**: Mark all tasks as completed or active with one click.
- **Clear Completed**: Remove all completed tasks.
- **Error Notifications**: The app shows error messages in case something goes wrong.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **TypeScript**: For static typing to catch errors early.
- **CSS (SCSS)**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For handling logic and asynchronous operations.
- **REST API**: To fetch, add, update, and delete todos from the server.

## How It Works
The app communicates with an API to fetch todos and update their status. You can interact with the app through a clean, user-friendly interface that lets you manage tasks, including filtering by status and clearing completed todos.
